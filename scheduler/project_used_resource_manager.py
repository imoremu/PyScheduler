    """ 
    Class to manage the used resources for a project, updating the used resources DataFrame with the resources allocated to tasks.

    This class allows the user to update the used resources DataFrame with the resources allocated to tasks, considering the date and filters provided.

    Attributes:
        used_resources_df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing the used resources with specific columns for dates and other categories such as team or project.
    """ 
    
    def __init__(self, used_resources_df):        
        """
        Initializes the manager with a DataFrame containing the used resources.

        Used Resources: This DataFrame includes resources used on each date for each task or responsibility group (if the date is in the past), or indicates the estimated resources consumed (if the date is in the future).
        It consists of the following types of columns:
        - Responsibility columns: Define the resource responsibility. These columns will be defined by the library user. E.g. [Team, Project, Area, SubArea, Responsible]
        User Resources could have more or fewer columns depending on their organization or even different ones with different names. 
        Responsibility columns accept regexp or * in their columns for managing resources groups.
        - Task ID column: Can be the task ID for resources allocated by task, or * for resources used on a date by a responsibility team.
        - Task information columns: References the Schedule table to obtain additional information and make it easier to use.
        - Date columns: Where the resources used for each task or team are included on a given date.

        Args:
            used_resources_df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing the used resources with specific columns for dates and other categories such as team or project.

    def clean_used_resources(self, clean_date):
        """
        Cleans the values of the used resource columns corresponding to future dates from the specified date.

        This method resets to zero all the values in date columns that are later than the provided 'clean_date',
        preparing the used resources DataFrame for a new resource assignment process without previously calculated
        values that might be outdated or incorrect.

        Args:
            clean_date (str or datetime): The date from which future used resources should be cleaned. This date can be a string or a datetime object.
                                          If it's a string, the expected format can be adjusted using the 'dayfirst' parameter.
            dayfirst (bool): Indicates whether the first element of the date is the day (True) or the month (False). Default is True, useful for common formats outside the US, like DD/MM/YYYY.

        Returns:
            None: This method does not return any values. It modifies the 'used_resources_df' DataFrame in-place.

        Examples:
            # Example with date string
            manager.clean_used_resources('15/10/2024')
